# Environmental Markets

## Overall Picture

The Environmental Services Markets as of 2022 is composed only of products and services that do not comply with mass retail needs. Stock exchanges are barely recognizing some of the environmental services as commodities or secondary markets. Within them they include carbon offset bonds, California Water Futures and some other Agro Futures.

## What is the Carbon Bonds Market

In 1997, during the United Nations Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto, world leaders tried to solve the environmental problem by introducing to the world the first concept of a carbon credit market that economically compensates for activities that sequester carbon from the atmosphere with exchange certificates between those who need them and those who can offer them. 

As of today, this instrument is already in operation and it depends on the provisions of the Paris Agreement signed in November 2016. Each country (or jurisdiction) determines the price allocation mechanism and its correspondence with the local laws of economic dynamics, so in some countries these guidelines are carried out regionally due to the federal governments that compose them. *(Open Knowledge, Worldbank; https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/33809)*

As of December 31, 2020, the total CO2 emissions market was estimated at $260.79 USD billion with a price per bond of $18.691 USD. 

By July 2021, the price had risen to $ 34.981 USD (+ 87%) putting this market at $ 488 billion USD in total capitalization. It is important to mention that the capital flow is ca $ 43 billion USD. And this is only one of the many environmental services markets available to tap in.

***Source***: *The IHS Markit Global Carbon Index was the first to track the most important emissions markets since 2016, therefore it is the one that offers the most clarity as to how the price of each ton of CO2 has steadily risen in price. The prices of this instrument represent the value in USD of 1 ton of Carbon (USD / tCO2e).*


This rise is considered one of the cultural consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when taking into account two reasons, 1) a paradigm shift in consumer trends and 2) also an industrialized need to accelerate production after the pandemic.

As a consequence, The Financial Times reported that CO2 emission bonds were the best performing commodity during 2020 and 2021.

Years have passed since this mechanism was put into operation and unfortunately the amount of carbon that this instrument is removing from the atmosphere barely corresponds to 22% of annual CO2 emissions.

Although there is optimism in the current price it is still insufficient. It is estimated that prices need to reach between $ 50 - $ 100 to achieve the minimum GHG reduction stipulated by the Paris Agreements.

Now, one of the main reasons for the capitalization of carbon credits not to move faster is because this market only includes macro actors such as governments and corporations which, strictly speaking, are the ones with the most resources available to combat the problem. In addition, it is mainly these actors who emit more GHG tons due to their industrial activities. 

To further aggravate the problem, governments and corporations, despite coming from human organizations, have agendas. In recent years we have seen how the agreements established in the Kyoto convention and the Paris Agreements become a bargaining chip to ratify the views of political or economic groups (*https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-54797743*) without civil society having any opinion on the matter (despite the fact that Climate change affects us all).
