# Understanding Environmental Frameworks

## What are Environmental Services?

Ecosystems are one of the most important elements that contribute to human well-being. Ecosystem services (ES), which are defined as benefits that ecosystems provide to humans, are key to the survival of the human kind. According to academic general consensus these services can be divided into four main categories: provisioning, supporting, regulating, and cultural services (IPBES, n.d.) which are described in the following table:

***Table 1***: *Types of ecosystem services*

| Type of ES | Definition | Examples |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Provisioning services | Services that can be directly extracted from an ecosystem | <ul><li>Food</li><li>Water</li><li>Timber</li></ul> |
| Regulating services | Processes in an ecosystem that help moderate natural phenomena | <ul><li>Water purification</li><li>Pollination</li><li>Climate regulation</li><ul><li>CO2 Removal</li></ul></ul> |
| Cultural services | Non-material benefits from an ecosystem that contribute to the cultural development of a society | <ul><li>Recreation</li><li>Education</li><li>Aesthetic appreciation</li></ul> |
| Supporting services | Natural processes that help sustain the rest of ecosystem services | <ul><li>Photosynthesis</li><li>Nutrient cycling</li><li>Soil creation</li></ul> |

## What is Ecosystem Degradation?

Ecosystem degradation is defined by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (n.d.) as the “long-term reduction in an ecosystem’s structure, functionality, or capacity to provide benefits to people”,  therefore whenever an ecosystem is degraded its capacity to provide ecosystem services reduces. According to Delgado, L. and Marín, V. (2020) an ecosystem is only considered as degraded whenever the causes for change are human modifications and not natural phenomena. Human pressures on ecosystems have increased to a scale in such a way that during the last 3 centuries forests have been reduced by 50%, there has been a loss of around 35% of mangroves in 20 years, and 20% of coral reefs have been lost in the last few decades (Millenium Ecosystem Assessment,  2005, p.26-29).

The degradation of ecosystems has a great impact on human well-being. Even though ecosystem degradation trends have coincided with improvements on health indices globally, there have been studies that show a relationship between ecosystem degradation and the prevalence of several diseases. According to Myer, S. et al. (2013), some diseases have spread due to a change in wild-life and human interactions. As human populations invade wildlife habitat, they get more exposed to diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Additionally, the loss of ecosystems has a negative effect on water quality, which provokes the outbreak of several diseases. According to the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), each year around 1.7 million people die from diseases related to water sanitation issues.

Furthermore, whenever ecosystems are degraded or lost, the human population becomes more vulnerable to different natural phenomena such as floods, hurricanes, and fires. Healthy ecosystems such as wetlands, forests, and mangroves act as natural buffers against natural disasters, reducing the impact on the human population. Furthermore, whenever an ecosystem is healthy and diverse they become more resilient towards these phenomena. On the other hand, whenever an ecosystem is degraded it loses its capacity to sequester carbon, which increases the effects of climate change, and the frequency of climate related disasters.

## Reforestation vs Restoration

Important! Symbiotik’s approach is to  find a balance between highly marketable environmental services and long term environmental restoration.

In order to reverse the effects of ecosystem degradation and climate change, in the past few decades there has been an increase in reforestation projects. However, the approach given to these projects has been one that doesn’t take into account systematic change. Most reforestation projects have the goal to reestablish vegetation cover in deforested areas without taking into account the species and biodiversity used for the project, ending up with tree monocultures with species that aren’t native to the area and prioritizing those that are fast-growing and have good quality timber (Le, H. et al, 2020). The problem with having single-species plantations is that forests become more susceptible to disturbances such as fires and pest outbreaks (Le, H. et al, 2020). On the other hand, by having monoculture tree plantations other ecosystem services such as biodiversity, watershed protection, and hill slope stability are not recovered (FAO, 2005).

The difference between reforestation and ecological restoration is that ecological restoration focuses on the recovery of the ecosystem’s structure, productivity, and species diversity, aiming to restore the processes and functions of the original ecosystem. On the other hand, reforestation has the goal to plant trees on areas previously occupied by forests (FAO, 2005).

According to Palmer, M. and Filoso, S. (2010), in order to have a successful restoration, it is important to measure ecosystem processes that support specific ecosystem services. The measurement of ecosystem processes give information that show if the actions implemented on an ecosystem are actually leading to restoration and the delivery of ecosystem services. As Herrick, J., Schuman, G., and Rango, A. (2006) propose, during the restoration projects implemented or monitored by Symbiotik Network’ oracles, we will be taking into account ecological process indicators that show the restoration of the three most important attributes on an ecosystem, soil stability, hydrologic function, and biotic integrity. By doing so, we intend to recover essential ecosystem services for human well-being such as the provision of good quality water, the protection of human populations to natural disasters or the sequestration of CO2 to help mitigate climate change.

## How do we want to contribute?

In order to contribute to the  solution of this problem, the Symbiotik Network is aiming at enhancing and documenting the value of environmental recovery through long term decentralized and community driven projects with the main goal of assigning financial value to the environmental services that will create a domino effect by recovering the environmental assets that  produces them. 

We use global frameworks to accomplish this goal through iterative projects. 
For reference, our Environmental Service Framework is The Common Classification of Ecosystem Services ([CICES](https://cices.eu/)) ; and our value attribution model is based on UN’s [SEEA EA](https://seea.un.org/ecosystem-accounting). Other information and frameworks are created internally but available for reference and consultation on each project’s repositories.
