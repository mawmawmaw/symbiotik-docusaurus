# About us

## What is Symbiotik?

Symbiotik is a **decentralized** platform based on blockchain technology that seeks to finance and scale **projects** of high **positive** environmental **impact.**

This can be achieved through a **democratic,** open, **transparent** and **accessible** to all **market** of **digital** environmental **assets.**

**The** environmental **assets** are **linked** to **physical**** spaces **where** regenerative** techniques are implemented.

## Why do we exist? _**&quot;Raison d&#39;être&quot;** _

We **exist** to make **taking care** of the **planet** economically **attractive** and **accessible** to **all**.

Very few human beings on the planet have had the opportunity to take real and impactful action to solve the problem of climate change. For decades we have lived with the general idea that the only civil way to reverse environmental degradation was from the personal trench, changing consumption habits and, perhaps, joining GreenPeace.

While it is true that stopping buying plastics, avoiding eating meat, and recycling our garbage are great human actions and sources of peace for the soul (as well as a respectable seal of personal identity), it is also true that we can create a high-impact mechanism with rapid scalability to help solve this problem more comprehensively.

We exist to create that mechanism that will permit any person on this planet to take real and impactful action to protect the health of our home.

## What do we want to solve?

**Symbiosis** is a close ecological **relationship** between the individuals of two (or more) different species. Sometimes a symbiotic relationship **benefits both** species, sometimes one species **benefits at the other&#39;s expense** , and in other cases **neither** species **benefits.**

**Humans** have **benefited** at the **expense** of **the planet&#39;s** wellbeing **for a very long time.**

**Warming** by the end of the 21st century will **lead** to high to very high **risk** of **severe** , widespread and irreversible impacts **globally** (high confidence). Depending on the rate and magnitude of change and the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, climate change will alter ecosystems, food systems, infrastructure, coastal, urban and rural areas, human health and livelihoods.

But **, why** would **humans** continue to **destroy** the very **home** from which they greatly benefit from, and even depend on?

We must admit that the past several decades have witnessed various **attempts** to change course. Examples include: successful dissemination of scientific research, improving energy and resource efficiency, and various international agreements aimed at reducing emissions.

**Despite** these **efforts** , human society has **not** been **successful** in significantly lessening the potential for environmental catastrophe.

**Why?**

- **Individualistic culture** : Humans always have choices. The choices we make in our everyday lives, and societal institutions are shaped by our mental models. Our mental models are based on the underlying structure (i.e culture). Culture is something that is materialized in patterns of practices and institutions. Studies confirm higher ecological footprint for more individualistic countries, as people in these countries tend to undermine the anthropological impacts on the planet (Komatsua, Rappley, Silovab, 2019).

Furthermore, centralization makes it easier for important decisions to just be controlled by a small percentage of society that have their own political and economical agenda such as institutions and corporations. Those decisions more often than not, do not work alongside nature because they follow their own independent interests.

- **Linear economy:** This type of economy results in an &quot;extract-make-dispose&quot; mentality because it assumes a constant supply of natural resources. The &quot;extract-make-dispose&quot; mentality causes unsustainable pressures on the environment. Unsustainable pressures on the environment jeopardizes the provision of ecosystem services, which diminishes human&#39;s well being. Furthermore, the degradation of ecosystem services jeopardizes the supply of materials, which in turn, raises the prices of goods and services, affecting the economy.

Another aspect of this type of economy is the focus on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as an indicator for economic growth / progress. As this indicator increases, the natural capital of the planet significantly decreases because it is not socially or ecologically adjusted (Desai, 2018). If the GDP took into account the social or environmental impact that was incurred to achieve a certain economic growth, then this indicator would tell a whole different story about the &quot;progress&quot; being made.

- **Preset value boundary:** The way we value environmental services has not changed for centuries. Generally, we approach natural ecosystems from an economic perspective that seeks to transform what already exists into goods or services and make them part of a market that offers financial incentives in the short-medium term.

Most of the current markets in the world do not directly recognize environmental services as sources of economic value on which to generate profitability. This is why no company considers in its profit and loss report the number of trees planted, but rather the amount of wood purchased, recorded as an input for some other manufacturing process. This is how forests and other natural ecosystems take the back seat and become collateral damage.
