# Manifesto

The **state** of the **home** we live in sheds light on the **state** of our **soul**.

**We believe it&#39;s time** to acknowledge the symbiotic relationship that exists between all biotic and abiotic elements that occupy space on this planet.

**We can heal** ourselves from self-destructive mental models which push us further apart, and make us weak, unstable, afraid.

**We must change** course to preserve and regenerate our home and we must do it together because the power of working together is unshakable.

**We must stop** relying on corporations or governments which have their own independent agendas.

Short-term doesn&#39;t cut it.

**Everyone should** be able to combat climate change by contributing in a meaningful and significant way in long-term solutions.

**We consider all** stakeholders to be at the epicenter of decision making in all conservation projects.

**Nature needs a voice** that vows to constantly protect her.

Decentralization is what allows everyone to be that voice, and a building block for the development of our new world.

**We use** blockchain technology to create a decentralized platform that connects all the voices.

But, actions speak louder than words alone,

**We ensure** the implementation of regenerative techniques on degraded physical spaces.

**We must monitor** the progress of the regenerative projects to ensure successful outcomes and iterate if needed.

**We can validate** the information with an oracle that acts as a bridge between the blockchain and the real world.

**We connect** real physical spaces with environmental digital assets to give meaning, that transcends, to any asset owned by our community.

**It transcends** because we ensure others can inherit the beauty of nature.
