# Monitoring and Results Reporting

## A. Extension

The first step for the monitoring process is the documentation of the extent of the ecosystem accounting area (EAA). The ecosystem accounting area (EAA) is the geographical territory for which an ecosystem account is compiled (United Nations, 2021). The second step involves the registration of the extent of the ecosystem asset divided by its uses, inside the EEA.

The tracking of the ecosystem extent is relevant because of the following reasons:

1. Changes due to deforestation, desertification, agricultural conversion, urban expansion and other forms of ecosystem change can be recorded throughout time.
2. Supports the measurement of ecosystem diversity and the derivation of indicators of changes in biodiversity.
3. When information underpinning an extent account is mapped, it supports an understanding of the locations and configuration of the ecosystem assets within the EAA and how it is changing over time (e.g, proximity to human pressures such as cultivated areas or fragmentations of the landscape).
4. Provides an underlying infrastructure for the measurement of ecosystem condition and for the measurement and modeling of many ecosystem services. In both cases, the relevant indicators of condition and services will commonly vary by ecosystem type or asset, and will depend on the location and configuration (spatial arrangement) of ecosystem assets or types within an EAA.
5. Supports the validation of the monetary value of ecosystem services.

### Structure of an ecosystem extent account

The structure of an ecosystem extent account consists of entries involving an opening extent, closing extent, and additions and reductions in extent. Entries are in terms of area using measurement units appropriate for the scale of analysis. e.g, hectares, square meters or kilometers. Depending on the availability of data, an extension to the ecosystem extent account may be developed to classify ecosystem changes / conversions by the reasons of change by using the proposal of UNCCD for classifying conversions (UNCCD, 2017).

The column heading corresponds to the selected ecosystem use within a specific ecosystem asset. Each ecosystem use corresponds to a specific ecosystem services&#39; physical flow. It is important to account the extent of each ecosystem use for each ecosystem asset within an ecosystem accounting area (EAA), and then, aggregate the information, to get an overall extension for each ecosystem use inside the EAA using a table such as Table 6 but indicating that it pertains to the aggregation of uses in all ecosystem assets within the EAA.

<div align="center">
    <img src="/img/monitoring/01.png" alt="Table 6: Stylized example of ecosystem extent account pertaining to ecosystem use within an ecosystem asset."/>
    Table 6: Stylized example of ecosystem extent account pertaining to ecosystem use within an ecosystem asset.
    <br/><br/>
</div>

The relevant accounting entries are the following (United Nations, 2021):

Opening and closing extent: represent the total area of the ecosystem use and ecosystem asset for a given ecosystem type at the beginning and end of an accounting period, generally 6 months.

Additions to extent: represent increases in the area of an ecosystem use and ecosystem asset.

–Managed expansion: represents an increase in the area of an ecosystem type due to direct human activity in the ecosystem, including the unplanned effects of such activity. Examples include the conversion of forests into cultivated land or land reclamation work in coastal areas. Human activity may also create new areas of more natural ecosystem types, for example by the reforestation of cultivated areas.

–Unmanaged expansion: represents an increase in area of an ecosystem type resulting from natural processes, including seeding, sprouting, suckering or layering. Unmanaged expansion can be influenced by human activity, for example, the expansion of deserts due to the effects of climate change, or result from abandonment of land by people.

Reductions in extent: represent decreases in the area of an ecosystem use and ecosystem asset.

–Managed reduction: represents a decrease in the area of an ecosystem type due to direct human activity in the ecosystem, including the unplanned effects of such activity, or cases where the activity may be illegal. Examples include deforestation and increases in urban areas.

–Unmanaged reduction: represents a decrease in area of an ecosystem type associated with natural processes. Unmanaged regression can be influenced by human activity for example the loss of coral reefs due to the effects of climate change, or result from abandonment of land by people.

Depending on the extent and type of ecosystem change in use that occurs in ecosystem assets, it can be considered that the ecosystem type has suffered a conversion. Nevertheless, for a conversion in ecosystem type to occur, an extent threshold must be reached for each ecosystem use. Ecosystem conversions refer to situations in which, for a given location, there is a change in ecosystem type involving a distinct and persistent change in the ecological structure, composition and function which, in turn, is reflected in the supply of a different set of ecosystem services (United Nations, 2021). Even though determining the precise time at which an ecosystem conversion takes place may be a matter of ecological uncertainty, by adopting an annual or semestral reporting approach, there will be a clear recording structure in place that ensures consideration of changes on a regular basis and allows changes to be recorded at appropriate points in time.

## B. Condition

Ecosystem condition is the quality of an ecosystem measured in terms of its abiotic and biotic characteristics. Condition is assessed with respect to an ecosystem&#39;s composition, structure and function which, in turn, underpin the ecosystem integrity of the ecosystem, and support its capacity to supply ecosystem services on an ongoing basis. Measures of ecosystem condition may reflect multiple values and may be undertaken across a range of temporal and spatial scales.(United Nations, 2021).

Ecosystem condition is often defined by measuring the similarity (or the distance) of a current ecosystem to a reference state, such as minimally impacted by people or a historical state (Costanza, 1992; Palmer &amp; Febria, 2012). Ecosystem condition can be described by assessing combinations of physical, chemical and biological indicators and their changes over time (United Nations, 2021).

In ecology, the description of ecosystem condition is strongly rooted in the concept of ecosystem integrity, which implies an unimpaired condition of being complete or undivided (Karr, 1993). Ecosystem integrity is defined as the ecosystem&#39;s capacity to maintain its characteristic composition, structure, functioning and self-organization over time within a natural range of variability (Pimentel &amp; Edwards, 2000). Ecosystems with high integrity or condition are typically more resilient, i.e., more able to recover from disturbances or to adapt to environmental changes (Holling, 1973).

Ecosystem condition and ecosystem services are linked, but the relationship varies between different services, and often is not linear. For many services, ecosystems in better condition can support a greater quantity and quality of the relevant ecosystem services, providing an argument for sustainable ecosystem management.

The tracking of the ecosystem condition is relevant because of the following reasons:

1. Supports the efficacy of the regenerative technique implemented in a given ecosystem asset and the monetary value of ecosystem services throughout time.
2. Supports alignment with other data on ecosystems, for example concerning extent and ecosystem services.
3. Builds upon and synthesizes rather than replaces, existing monitoring systems.
4. Supports decisions on ecosystem management to ameliorate the state of the environment.
5. Provides an insight into the condition of the environment, and thus, the state of the flow of ecosystem services.
6. It can be compared with observed measurements of certain variables to information about critical thresholds, for example from scientific studies or fisheries management work, and with determined target values, for example from a reference condition.

### Defining and selecting characteristics and variables of ecosystem condition

The first stage in measuring ecosystem condition involves setting the measurement focus and defining and selecting ecosystem characteristics and associated variables. Ecosystem characteristics are the system properties of the ecosystem and its major abiotic and biotic components (water, soil, topography, vegetation, biomass, habitat and species). Examples of characteristics include vegetation, water quality and soil type. The term ecosystem characteristics is intended to encompass all of the perspectives required to describe the long term, &#39;typical behavior&#39; of an ecosystem.

The SEEA ecosystem condition typology (ECT) is a hierarchical typology for organizing data on ecosystem condition characteristics. By describing a meaningful ordering and coverage of characteristics, it can be used as a template for variable and indicator selection and provide a structure for aggregation. The ECT also establishes a common language to support increased comparability among different ecosystem condition studies.

Ecosystems and their characteristics are highly complex, and hence the ECT provides a balance that meets the requirements for statistical purposes and is also ecologically meaningful in terms of ecosystem structure, function and composition. Since different ecosystem types have different characteristics, which in turn should be described by different variables and indicators, the ECT is designed to be universal. Thus, it is expected to be relevant for all realms and biomes, while also supporting direct reference to ecosystem-specific metrics at lower levels.

<div align="center">
    <img src="/img/monitoring/02.png" alt="Table 7: The SEEA Ecosystem Condition Typology (ECT) (United Nations, 2021)"/>
    Table 7: The SEEA Ecosystem Condition Typology (ECT) (United Nations, 2021)
    <br/><br/>
</div>

**Structure of an ecosystem condition variable account**

In an EAA, the many ecosystem assets that comprise each ecosystem type can each have different values for the variables describing condition. This spatial variation is caused by spatially explicit patterns of pressures on ecosystems, ecosystem management, or characteristics that shape ecosystems such as slope and elevation.  

To take the spatially explicit character of ecosystem condition into account, the values recorded in an ecosystem condition variable account should be calculated as the area weighted arithmetic mean of ecosystem assets belonging to the particular ecosystem type within the EAA. It follows that if the variable values for one or more assets change between accounting periods, the average value for the ecosystem type will also change.

Qualitative variables or measures such as species presence or water quality that are measured on an ordinal scale from low to high can be used as well. For these variables, the account records the relative share of one of the classes over the entire EAA (e.g., the percentage of ecosystem assets where a species is present).

The common temporal units for aggregation are semesters or years. However, data will not all pertain to the same point in time or period depending on the variable. In addition, data are collected at different temporal resolutions spanning from seconds or days (e.g., air quality measurements) to weeks, months or seasons (e.g., productivity measurements from earth observation), to years or multiple years (land cover changes, species records). Bringing these observations to a common temporal unit or a common reporting year can be done using the several methods such as temporal aggregations, linear interpolation, or recording smoothed data in the condition account.

    <br/><br/>
</div>

### Ecosystem condition indicators

Ecosystem condition indicators are rescaled versions of ecosystem condition variables. They are derived when condition variables are set against reference levels determined with respect to ecosystem integrity. Two steps are involved. First, data values for each variable are transformed to a common dimensionless scale, with the two endpoints of the scale (or a range along the scale) representing a top value (1 or 100%) and a bottom value (0 or 0%) for that variable. Second, the transformed data are converted to ecosystem indicators. The simplest conversion uses two reference levels to reflect a high or low condition score by applying a linear transformation.

Applying a reference level converts that variable from being a measure of trends in ecosystem characteristics to an assessment of ecosystem condition in relation to a reference. Such normalization adds value in the interpretation of trends and is also required by any later aggregation steps, which need commensurate metrics measured on the same scale using common units (Nardo et al., 2005).

A reference level is the value of a variable at the reference condition, against which it is meaningful to compare past, present or future measured values of the variable. The difference between the value of a variable and its reference level represents the distance from the reference condition. Reference levels are usually set with high and low levels reflecting the limits or endpoints of the range of a condition variable that can be used in re-scaling. For example, the high level may refer to a natural state and the low level may refer to a degraded state where ecosystem processes are below a threshold for maintaining function (such as ecosystem collapse; (D. A. Keith et al., 2013)). For Symbiotik, the purpose is to measure ecosystem integrity and for this purpose the reference level should be established in relation to a common reference condition.

### Structure of an ecosystem condition indicator account

The structure of the ecosystem condition indicator account builds directly on the ecosystem condition variable account by relating each variable to a reference level. Each variable is rescaled (transformed) to a uniform dimensionless scale [0, 1] using its reference level. The data in the indicator account allows descriptions of trends in condition to be interpreted relative to an agreed reference condition based on ecosystem integrity. This allows for statements concerning whether, for a given variable, ecosystem condition can be considered high (close to the reference level) or low (distant from the reference level). The indicator account can be used to monitor and report change in values over time (United Nations, 2021).

<div align="center">
    <img src="/img/monitoring/04.png" alt="Table 9: Ecosystem condition indicator account (United Nations, 2021)"/>
    Table 9: Ecosystem condition indicator account (United Nations, 2021)
    <br/><br/>
</div>

There is not a direct, linear relationship between changes in ecosystem condition and changes in ecosystem capacity. Accounting for condition therefore provides a structured framework for collating data to analyze this relationship in combination with data on flows of ecosystem services. Furthermore, the data from the ecosystem condition indicator account will also underpin the derivation of composite indices of ecosystem condition. Such indices may be of considerable power in conveying general messages around changes in ecosystem condition. A number of different aggregations of indicators from a single ecosystem condition indicator account are possible following different approaches to aggregation (United Nations, 2021).

## C. Ecosystem services in physical terms

Accounting for ecosystem services in physical terms aims to record, in an accounting structure, the flows of ecosystem services over an accounting period in physical units such as cubic meters and tonnes. Physical quantification commonly focuses on measurement of ecosystem structures, processes and functions; i.e., the supply side of ecosystem service flows but quantification of ecosystem contributions can also take place through a focus on the use of ecosystem services, for example the number of visits to a national park (United Nations, 2021).

The aim in ecosystem accounting is to provide as comprehensive coverage as practical of the supply and use of different ecosystem services within an ecosystem accounting area. The choices about which ecosystem services to include in a set of ecosystem accounts will depend in part on the data and resources available for the compilation of estimates.

The tracking of the flow of ecosystem services in physical terms is relevant because of the following reasons:

1. Identify the users of the services, and thus, derive its importance in the societal sphere.
2. Assess how patterns of supply and use of ecosystem services are changing over time, and thus, analyze the significance of particular ecosystems as ecosystem service suppliers.
3. Supports analysis of tradeoffs between different ecosystem services as part of spatial planning and land management.
4. Provide information to support delineation of areas for specific land uses, including conservation and environmental protection.
5. Provides the infrastructure for calculating the monetary value of ecosystem services.
6. Supports the validation of the monetary value of ecosystem services throughout time.

### Structure of an ecosystem service supply and use account in physical terms.

In general, the measurement scope of a supply and use account will be established on the basis of the ecosystem services supplied by all ecosystem assets within an EAA. A single supply and use table is compiled for one accounting period, usually one semester. That is, the entries for supply and use show the total flows of each ecosystem service for that time period. In addition, the presentation of data on the supply and use of ecosystem services in the form of maps is intended. Overlaying maps for different ecosystem services can provide a ready source of information on places that might be considered ecosystem services &quot;hot spots.&quot;

The compilation of ecosystem services will be undertaken using fine level spatial data in order to be able to present the information on the supply and use of ecosystem services for each individual ecosystem asset within the EAA. The supply is attributed to an ecosystem asset and then type as an overall.

Generally, ecosystem services may be supplied from locations that are the same as, or different from, the locations in which they are used and where the benefits are received. Since ecosystem services have varying spatial characteristics and follow certain flow paths, linkages between supply and use can occur via several pathways (United Nations, 2021):

• Some benefits from ecosystem services are received in the same place they are supplied (in situ ecosystem services). Most provisioning services fall in this category.

• Some benefits are received in the surrounding landscape and beyond (omnidirectional ecosystem services). Global climate regulation services are an example in which the benefits are global, but the ecological process can occur in any ecosystem.

• Some benefits are received downstream or downslope from where they are supplied (directional ecosystem services). For example, water may be purified upstream from where the consumption of water occurs. Directional ecosystem services can also depend on spatial proximity, i.e., where people receive benefits by being near, but not necessarily in, the relevant ecosystem.

    <br/><br/>
</div>

## D. Ecosystem services in monetary terms

The set of ecosystem services included in the monetary ecosystem services flow account should align with the set of ecosystem services included in the physical ecosystem services flow account. The primary scope of the account is determined by the set of ecosystem assets located within the EAA. These are considered the suppliers of the ecosystem services. The set of users included in the account is focused on different types of SNA economic units (i.e., businesses, governments, households) that are resident in the EAA. In addition, the use table also allows for recording use by non-resident economic units (i.e., those economic units who are resident outside the EAA); and for use by other ecosystem assets (i.e., flows of intermediate services). This scope of users is required to ensure that the supply of ecosystem services by resident ecosystem assets can be fully allocated.

Intermediate services are inputs used by ecosystem assets to supply final ecosystem services. In monetary terms, total supply of ecosystem services will be increased through the recording of intermediate services. This is offset by recording use of ecosystem services by ecosystem assets, distinct from entries pertaining to final ecosystem services which are used by economic units. There is no double counting that results from recording intermediate services in this way. Note that in a given chain of flows, the ecosystem type recorded as using the intermediate service should also be the ecosystem type recorded as supplying the related final ecosystem service.

Monetary values are derived using the adequate valuation technique as explained in Chapter 4.

    <img src="/img/monitoring/07.png" alt="Table 12: Supply table of ecosystem services in monetary terms. (United Nations, 2021)"/>

**Changes in the monetary value of ecosystem assets inside a EAA**

The monetary ecosystem asset account records the monetary values of all ecosystem assets within an ecosystem accounting area at the beginning (opening) and end (closing) of each accounting period; as well as changes in the value of those assets over the accounting period. Changes in the monetary value of ecosystem assets are separated into five broad types: ecosystem enhancement, ecosystem degradation, ecosystem conversions, other changes in the volume of ecosystem assets, and revaluations as a result of price changes.

<div align="center">
    <img src="/img/monitoring/12.png" alt="Table 17: Reasons for change in monetary valuation of ecosystem services within an ecosystem type that pertains to certain Ecosystem Accounting Area (EAA)."/>
    Table 17: Reasons for change in monetary valuation of ecosystem services within an ecosystem type that pertains to certain Ecosystem Accounting Area (EAA).
    <br/><br/>
</div>

-Ecosystem enhancement is the increase in the value of an ecosystem asset over an accounting period that is associated with an improvement in the condition of the ecosystem asset during that accounting period.

-Ecosystem degradation is the decrease in the value of an ecosystem asset over an accounting period that is associated with a decline in the condition of an ecosystem asset during that accounting period.

-Ecosystem conversions refer to situations in which, for a given location, there is a change in ecosystem type involving a distinct and persistent change in the ecological structure, composition and function which, in turn, is reflected in the supply of a different set of ecosystem services and different expected future returns.

-Revaluations are changes in the value of ecosystem assets over an accounting period that are due solely to movements in the unit prices of ecosystem services which underpin the derivation of the net present value of ecosystem assets.
