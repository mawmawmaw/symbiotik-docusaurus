# The mission

## How to preserve the planet earth?

We want to **shape** the **future** of the **planet** with the following **f** _ **oundations of decision-making** _in Symbiotik:

- **Community:** As mentioned before, change will not endure if individual agents advance their own interests independently. **Collective** action and **collaboration** is needed in order to make decisions that will actually protect the **health** of our planet. This can be achieved by the creation of a community that prefers **dialogues** and discussions over debates, and is open for deep **reflections** that can **transform** the mental models that self-destruct us. Community is needed in order to make important decisions that involve the future of our planet. In Symbiotik, every voice counts.

&quot;The scarcest resource is not oil, metals, clean air, capital, labor, or technology. It is our willingness to listen to each other and learn from each other and seek the truth instead of seeking to be right. &quot;

-Donella Meadows

- **Systems&#39; Thinking:** This is an approach of reasoning that is based on the fundamental notion of &quot;System&quot;, differing greatly from the &quot;independent mindset&quot; that has prevailed in western society. By thinking in systems, the relationship between the components inside the systems can be understood, and thus, their overall impact on the system&#39;s outcomes.

The value of nature can be better acknowledged with this type of thinking as the contributions of environmental services to the benefits that society enjoys can be identified and understood.

Decision-making that is based on analyzing the **whole picture** is more likely to produce results that **benefit**** all** in society, the environment and the economy. This type of thinking does not claim complete knowledge; it is about assessing the degree of system complexity, analyzing system dynamics, and making decisions that reduce the risk of negative outcomes.

- Our **backbone** : The foundational methodology that we use is the System of Environmental - Economic Accounting (United Nations, 2021) which presents the initial efforts to define a measurement framework for integrating biophysical data, tracking changes in ecosystems, and linking those changes to economic and human activity. This methodology is based on a **convergence** of **disciplines** in ecology, economics and statistics.

We use this methodology as the basis for monitoring the condition of the ecosystems and to report the results of the monitoring system (link to full explanation of &quot;Monitoring and Results Reporting). The monitoring of the condition of ecosystems is of utmost importance as this will ensure that physical spaces that are linked with digital assets are being successfully regenerated.

Questions we aim to answer in every environmental project through the methodology:

1. How is the condition, health and integrity of ecosystems and biodiversity changing over time and where are the main areas of degradation and improvement?
2. How can natural resources and ecosystems be better managed to ensure ongoing services and benefits such as energy, food supply, water supply, flood control, carbon storage, and recreational opportunities?
3. How should conservation efforts be focused?
4. What opportunities exist for the development of innovative programs based on incentives to conserve nature?

- **Iteration:** We focus on the process. Effective decision-making and risk management in the complex environment of climate change may be iterative: strategies can often be adjusted as new information and understanding develops during implementation. This will allow us to find the best alternative and innovate through the constant feedback we&#39;ll receive in each project. Hence, we follow the following iteration process:

1. Diagnosis: Each conservation project has its own unique context and purpose
2. Planning: Involves the input of all stakeholders
3. Taking action
4. Evaluating
5. Repeat

## What do we do?

### A. Valuation

- **Symbiotik synthesizes all the information about regenerative techniques that are backed up by scientific research.**

1. Involves the recuperation of information on regenerative techniques so they can be readily applied.

Research must be made, but it also involves the inclusion of knowledge from people working in-situ. We do not assume that something is going to work because it is backed up by a fancy institution without experience working in the field, nor do we underestimate the usefulness of listening to people that have traditional knowledge from living in the physical space we want to restore. We involve all stakeholders in the process.

- **Symbiotik ensures the successful implementation of the regenerative technique in adequate physical spaces.**

1. A regenerative technique is chosen by taking into account the context and purpose of the conservation project in each physical space.
2. Before any implementation is made, a reference condition is selected in order to have reference values to compare to when the implementation is completed.
3. Implementation of the regenerative technique
4. Identification of ecosystem services that are produced or enhanced by the technique.

- **Symbiotik values the ecosystem services derived from physical spaces that implement the regenerative technique.**

1. Identification of the benefits and beneficiaries of the ecosystem services derived from the implementation of the regenerative technique.
2. Choose adequate valuation techniques for each ecosystem service.

### B. Bridge between environmental services market and the physical world

- **Symbiotik supports a new generation of digital assets and applications to create a model of value generation through environmental services.**

1. Art inspired by the nature of the environmental project is created by our creative team.
2. The art is turned into a non-fungible-token (NFT).
3. The floor price of the NFT is linked to the value of the ecosystem services derived from the implementation of the regenerative technique in real physical spaces.

- **Symbiotik empowers any person on the planet who wants to take part in an environmental asset exchange model.**

1. The NFT&#39;s created are minted and exchanged in a peer-to-peer decentralized platform.
2. Holders get to know the extent of the positive impact that the NFT represents in the real world.
3. Holders own a digital environmental asset that will increase in value as the total value locked of the total accounting area is unlocked.

### C. Monitoring

- **Symbiotik verifies the condition of the physical spaces that are linked to the digital environmental assets in order to validate their monetary value inside the market.**

1. Identification of the key variables that must be periodically monitored.
2. Identification and selection of key variables for monitoring.
3. Compilation of necessary data to track the condition of the physical spaces throughout time.

- **Symbiotik acts as a reliable source of unalterable and secure environmental information for everyone to see.**

1. Documentation of:

1. The condition of the ecosystem where a regenerative technique was implemented.
2. The monetary value of the ecosystem services derived from the conservation project.
3. The total value locked remaining in the total accounting area (link)

We take advantage of blockchain technology to guarantee validation certainty, and information maintenance.

1. Report of results through an oracle linked to the decentralized network.

### Result

The value of the planet is factored into our financial system.

## Why now?

### The Environmental Services Markets

In 1997, during the United Nations Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto, world leaders tried to solve the environmental problem by introducing to the world the first concept of a carbon credit market that economically compensates for activities that sequester carbon from the atmosphere with exchange certificates between those who need them and those who can offer them.

As of today, this instrument is already in operation and it depends on the provisions of the Paris Agreement signed in November 2016. Each country (or jurisdiction) determines the price allocation mechanism and its correspondence with the local laws of economic dynamics, so in some countries these guidelines are carried out regionally due to the federal governments that compose them.

As of December 31, 2020, the total CO2 emissions market was estimated at $260.79 USD billion with a price per bond of $18.691 USD.

By July 2021, the price had risen to $ 34.981 USD (+ 87%) putting this market at $ 488 billion USD in total capitalization. It is important to mention that the capital flow is ca $ 43 billion USD.

By February 2022, the price has risen to $56.865 UD (+ 62.6 %) putting this market at $851 billion USD in total capitalization, and this is only one of the many environmental services markets available to tap in.

    <br/><br/>
</div>

The IHS Markit Global Carbon Index was the first to track the most important emissions markets since 2016, therefore it is the one that offers the most clarity as to how the price of each ton of CO2 has steadily risen in price. The prices of this instrument represent the value in USD of 1 ton of Carbon (USD / tCO2e).

This rise is considered one of the cultural consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when taking into account two reasons, 1) a paradigm shift in consumer trends and 2) also an industrialized need to accelerate production after the pandemic.

As a consequence, The Financial Times reported that CO2 emission bonds were the best performing commodity during 2020 and 2021. Years have passed since this mechanism was put into operation and unfortunately the amount of carbon that this instrument is removing from the atmosphere barely corresponds to 22% of annual CO2 emissions.

Although there is optimism in the current price it is still insufficient. It is estimated that prices need to reach between $ 50 - $ 100 per ton/e to achieve the minimum GHG reduction stipulated by the Paris Agreements.

Now, one of the main reasons why the capitalization of carbon credits has not moved faster is because this market only includes macro actors such as governments and corporations which, strictly speaking, are the ones with the most resources available to combat the problem. In addition, it is mainly these actors who emit more GHG tons due to their industrial activities.

To further aggravate the problem, governments and corporations, despite coming from human organizations, have independent agendas. In recent years we have seen how the agreements established in the Kyoto convention and the Paris Agreements become a bargaining chip to ratify the views of political or economic groups without civil society having any opinion on the matter (despite the fact that Climate change affects us all).

### The market of sustainable goods

In theory, there has been no better time in history to enter the sustainable supply market. Consumers, particularly young consumers, have laid the foundations so that, little by little, previously massive products become standards of environmental, endemic and above all ethical recognition.

For December 2020, the estimated value of the sustainability and green technologies industry was $ 11.2B USD per year, with growth projection for 2026 at a compound rate of 26.6% to place it at $ 36.5B USD.

Environmental awareness and concern has increased in the minds of consumers and there is a specific industrial interest in the use of clean energy and technology. This is leading the adoption of sustainability services and green solutions in the market.

Within this industry, the specific growth sectors of this industry rank the recognition services and the use of blockchain as the fastest growing since its implementation is ideal with the deficiencies in the current processes.

Likewise, by virtue of trying to understand the general panorama of the market, the NFTs exchange industry (only in the ethereum chain) has reached in 2021 a value of more than $43B USD with a constant growth since the technology took importance in the impact circles of the crypto world.

Just OpenSea, one of the main NFT open marketplaces in the world reports a monthly transaction value of over $3B, with no signs of stopping.

Both of these positive trends represent an important opportunity to place products that lead the next great wave of environmentally conscious and conscious consumers.

### The cost of environmental regeneration activities

For this model to be feasible, we need to take a look at the associated costs to regenerative activities.

Conservation efforts generally focus on protecting areas that have not been heavily altered by human activity (Holl et al. 2011), however the amount of available techniques is vast. Since ecosystems and their degradation differ widely, there is a scale of efforts (Fig. 1) ranging from unassisted recovery or &quot;passive restoration&quot; (where the main focus is to stop harmful activities and establish natural recovery mechanisms ) to human efforts actively trying to accelerate and influence the succession of the recovery path or &quot;active restoration&quot; where the projects seek to promote an accelerated recovery using external techniques or specific technology to achieve it.

In some of the most important efforts at the global level, this perspective has been taken as the basis for establishing a regeneration budgeting model that, by balancing different methodologies, can reduce direct implementation costs and allocate more resources to the long-term maintenance of these efforts or the placement of those resources in other environmental projects.

<div align="center">
    <img src="/img/the_mission/3.png" alt=""/>
</div>

Some of the most comprehensive studies in this regard, and from which we take many economic references, are those described in Benefits of Investing in Ecosystem Restoration for diverse areas in South Africa and What makes ecosystem restoration expensive? for forested/jungle areas in Brazil.

Some of the projections estimate that the average investment cost per hectare can vary between $ 760 and $ 1300 (US $. Ha − 1) (Brancalion et al., 2019) with variability scenarios between the techniques chosen to adjust the density of trees planted directly in the same space to be restored.

<div align="center">
    <img src="/img/the_mission/4.png" alt=""/>
</div>

The projections for similar projects in Latin America and Asia place the costs in the same ranges with very little variability and for North America and Europe they place these projections around $ 3000 (US $. Ha − 1) in the most extreme scenarios, corresponding to these increases to the difference in pricing for labor and the state of degradation of the ecosystems analyzed in these studies, which differ in these regions (Fig. 2).

One of the main barriers to implementing global impact and ambitious restoration programs is the scarcity of funds available to scale up efforts. This is why it is crucial to understand restoration costs in order to integrate them into viable economic models.

<div align="center">
    <img src="/img/the_mission/5.png" alt=""/>
</div>

Despite this, there is a severe lack of standardized approaches to solving this problem since the impacted ecosystems depend directly on different jurisdictions or sovereignties to resort to adequate technical resources to identify the best practices and methodologies in each one of the ecosystems.

It is very important to mention that considering even some of the most serious methodologies focused on specific regions, it is clear that it becomes practically impossible to identify the original natural conditions of the ecosystems completely, since there are no registration and monitoring mechanisms with high certainty for the endemic, climatic, systemic or biological identification of ecosystems.

That is why, in an effort to adopt a vision that prioritizes rapid, long-term and standardizable results, at Symbiotik we adopt an understanding where a universal approach cannot result in massive success. We must gradually develop local, verifiable and collaborative restoration methodologies in each of the regions where there is an opportunity to do so.

This then becomes an operational responsibility of the Protocol and we will rely on the Layer 2 structure of blockchain technology to provide certainty and follow-up to local projects to ensure their reproducibility and scalability and direct correlation with the value of assets in the market.
